Would you like me to now:

1. 🧱 Design the **feature architecture** (e.g., data models, screens, and interactions),
2. 🧠 Create a **wireframe or UI flow** (Figma-like plan), or
3. ⚡ Draft the **backend schema (SQLite/Firebase + API structure)** for implementation?

You can pick the direction — and I’ll build it out step by step.
